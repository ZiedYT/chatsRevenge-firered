DM me if you find any issues.
## Setup:
- Download [the latest release](https://github.com/ZiedYT/chatsRevenge-firered/releases/latest) and use the provided emulator
- Run `setup.exe` once.
- Download the windows app [here](https://github.com/ZiedYT/chats-revenge-public)
- Open the windows app and type your name and copy your token
- Get the twitch extension from [here](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/6fwhzhvt0ljihf9o1vzvjfp12jvkax)
- In the windows app make sure that the firered mod is enabled by going to
  - first tab `rewards`
  - `Game Mods`
  - Enable the firered checkbox
- Open the emulator and load the ROM. I used `Pokemon - Fire Red Version (U) (V1.1)` when making this.
- In the emulator, load the lua script. This script is not needed for the mod to work but needed to reduce visual bugs:
  - `Tools` > `Lua Scripting` > `New Lua Script Window`
  - A window will open. Click `Browse`
  - Go to the emulator folder > lua > gui.lua
  - `Run`
